   - Bin Store Sensor: Trigger Pin 4, Echo Pin 7
   - Servo Motor: Pin 9

### Software Setup

#### Arduino
1. Install required libraries through Arduino IDE:
   ```
   - Firebase Arduino Library
   - ArduinoJson
   - Servo
   ```
2. Create a `secrets.h` file with your credentials:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "your-wifi-ssid"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-wifi-password"
   #define REFERENCE_URL "your-firebase-url"
   ```
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board

#### Web Dashboard
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd smart-bin-dashboard
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure Firebase
   - Create a `.env` file with your Firebase configuration
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   ```
4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
